### Code and scripts for *de novo* analyses in DDD 4K datafreeze

These scripts are intended to document analysis of *de novo*
mutations within the DDD 4K (4293 trios). I haven't attempted to
make these scripts reusable, since they are fairly reliant on
specific files associated with the DDD datafreeze.
