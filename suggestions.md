### Gene sets for optimising external cohorts
 - [x] All dominant DDG2P genes.
 - [x] constrained genes, such as genes with a high pLI score, say in the top 10% of
   genes.

### Additional analyses
 - [ ] distribution of pLI vs gene significance
 - [x] missing dominant loss-of-function haploinsufficient neurodevelopmental DDG2P
   genes.
    - [x] Assess genes as being neurodevelopmental by HPO term. Possible top-level
      terms include:
        * HP:0011446 - Cognitive impairment
        * HP:0012443 - Abnormality of the brain
    - [x] Assess by target organ (i.e. brain/cognition) in DDG2P.
    - [x] union of target organ and HPO term genes
 - [ ] assess impact of using subset without diagnosed probands by rank-sum
   permutation of top pLI genes in diagnosed vs undiagnosed.
 - [ ] summary of novel genes: do they look different in any way from the other
   known genomewide genes.
    - are we starting to see more gain of function genes now that we are better
      powered with larger cohort to detect potentially effects in smaller regions
      of genes.
 - [ ] are there any similarities in biology amongst the novel genes.

### Clinical details to report phenotype of novel genes
 - [x] aggregate growth data, developmental milestones and HPO terms for each novel
   gene.
 - [ ] fill in missing cells for clinical tables generated from decipher information
 - [ ] distinguishing features of each novel gene to go in a main table
 - [ ] make sure to exclude phenotypes >10 SD from mean
